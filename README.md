Hi, 
This project is for me and for others,i.e. people could get answers about me in an time efficient manner, just speaking to my AI virtual assistant.

I will be integrating this chatbot on a cloud platform provided free services.
Current webapp is available at a specific url using Flask and Javascript.

In progress (research phase) of deploying webapp to a cloud platform



This virtual assistant is based on Deep Learning neural networks, Natural Langugage processing.

Frameworks: PyTorch

Source-code editor: Visual Studio Code

Modules: torch, random, json, ipython.display, math, numpy

Deep learning network type: Feedforward neural network path

Natural language processing: nltk package

Template for your "intenttss.json' you could create your own, catering your needs.

Note: Training data is a very time consuming process.
