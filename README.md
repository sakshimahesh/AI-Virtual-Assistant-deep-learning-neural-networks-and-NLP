**Intro**: Medium-scaled model: This deep learning model has been trained on over 220 lines per intent.(often the scale of real world applications)

Maintaining balance between performance and resource constraints.

Note: Training a medium scaled model data is a very time consuming process.


**Vision**: This project is designed to benefit both myself and others by providing quick, efficient answers through my AI virtual assistant and facilitating seamless meeting scheduling. Along with demonstrating my technical expertise in an practical way.


Progress: I will be integrating this chatbot on a cloud platform provided free services.
Current webapp is available at a specific url using Flask and Javascript.

In progress (research phase/build phase) of deploying webapp to a cloud platform while managing complexity of this project and performance optimization.



Frameworks, softwares, tools, etc: 

This virtual assistant is based on Deep Learning neural networks, Natural Langugage processing.

Frameworks: PyTorch

Source-code editor: Visual Studio Code

Modules: torch, random, json, ipython.display, math, numpy

Deep learning network type: Feedforward neural network path

Natural language processing: nltk package


Template for your "intenttss.json' you could create your own, catering your needs.
Over 220 lines per intent.
( I am unsure if I should be uploading my intents.json file. Let me know in the comments)
